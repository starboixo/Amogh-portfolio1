## 🚀 Running Locally

You'll need an active Node.js environment (v18+ recommended).

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   > *Note: This command uses concurrently to start both the Vite frontend server and a local Express API backend (running `api-server.js` on port 3001) to simulate the serverless functions locally.*

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
